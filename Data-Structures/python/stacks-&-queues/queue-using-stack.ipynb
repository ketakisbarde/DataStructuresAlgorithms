    "#This ia popular interview question. Implementation of a queue using stacks.\n",
    "#We have access to stacks push and pop operations. Using those we need to execute a qeueue's enqueue and dequeue operation\n",
    "\n",
    "#It can be done in two ways, by either making the enqueue operation costly(O(n)) or the dequeue operation costly(O(n))\n",
    "#In the first method, we need two stacks say s1 and s2 and we have maintain them such that the element entered first\n",
    "#Is always at the top of the stack s1. This way, for dequeue, we just need to pop from s1.\n",
    "#But for enqueueing, we have to make the enqueued item reach the bottom of the stack.\n",
    "#For that, we will have to pop the elements of s1 one by one and push them onto stack 2, then add the new item to stack1 ,\n",
    "#And then again pop everything from stack2 and push it back to stack 1., so the new item is now at the last.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Lets implement a queue using stacks(array implementation) using this method first"
