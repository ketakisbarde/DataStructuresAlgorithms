    "#### Queues are another form of linear data structure very similar to stacks. The difference is queues follow the FIFO rule - First In First Out, much like real life queues,Where the person gets in first, gets to leave first.\n",
    "#### Quesues can be implemented with both arrays and linked lists but the array implementation is not eficient because for removing an element from the queues, which happens from the front of the array(queue),the indices of the array have to be updated every time, essentially making it an O(n) operation,Whereas the same operation can be done in O(1) time with linked lists.\n",
    "#### Queues have enqueue and dequeue operations which correspond to the push and pop operations of stacks , only difference being dequeue removes element from the front\n",
    "##### Time complexities are as follows:\n",

    "- Enqueue - O(1)\n",
    "- Dequeue - o(1)"
